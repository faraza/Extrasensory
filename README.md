# Extrasensory
Extrasensory is an iOS and Apple Watch app that helps you build and break habits by tracking your thoughts as they occur.

The ability to track every urge (e.g. to bite your nails or slouch or eat junk food) would be extremely valuable to predict your habit lapses and see your progress over time. However, going through the trouble of unlocking your iPhone, opening an app, and logging the data by hand would be so high friction that a user realistically wouldn't do this.

Extrasensory solves this issue by making it a one button tap on your Apple Watch. There are also future plans for letting you log urges through Siri or with keyboard shortcuts on your computer.

Future Work Includes predicting lapses before they occur and giving you proactive messages to help you when you are in the danger zone of lapsing on your habit.
